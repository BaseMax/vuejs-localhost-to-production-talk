# From Localhost to Production: CI/CD for Vue with GitHub Actions

Take your Vue.js apps from local development to live production with a modern, automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. In this session, we’ll walk through building a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly workflow to lint, test, build, and deploy Vue projects — whether you’re targeting static hosts, CDNs, or full-stack environments.

## Overview

In many Vue projects, deployment is either manual or inconsistent, leading to human error, lost time, and broken builds. With the growing adoption of Vite, TypeScript, and fast deployment platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Docker-based servers, the need for an effective, automated CI/CD pipeline is more important than ever.

Whether you're working solo or in a team, you'll leave with a real-world example and a reusable CI/CD template that brings confidence and speed to your deployment workflow.

- How to automate linting, testing, building, and deployment with best practices
- How to customize workflows for different deployment targets (static, dynamic, custom servers)
- Understand the role of caching, environments, secrets, and rollback strategies
